This folder contains the source code for the Desktop InfoTagger coordinate conversion program and the import/export files used for testing
There were two main collaborators on this file: Cody Rauseo and Jeff Rattray
Cody named his files Task7.py since this was the 7th Sprint Task Assigned
Jeff would download those files to make edits and upload DesktopInfoTagger.py and Task7.py whenever he made changes
Jeff had a visual studios project that automatically named the source file that way
the code should be the same. Git also served as our version control system so if you need to roll back versions, the code is there
